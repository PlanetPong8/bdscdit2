      <h2>WHAT IS DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AT BOTANY DOWNS SECONDARY COLLEGE?</h2>
      <p>Digital technologies is a technology categorised subject at Botany Downs Secondary College, that can be taken from Year 9 all the way to Year 13, varying from digital technologies and digital technologies with programming. People who are creative, logical thinkers and problem-solvers move beyond being users and consumers of digital technologies to become creators of new technologies for authentic users. The students will learn computer science and programming concepts that are behind the creation of digital technologies. They will apply computational thinking to solve problems by writing algorithms for digital devices to execute, and design and deliver digital outcomes according to the new digital technologies curriculum.</p>

    <div data-aos="fade-left">
      <h2>YEAR 10 DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
      <p>Year 10 Digital Technologies is an optional choice for students who might be interested into coding/programming, computers, sciences, media, web development and digital infrastructure. This course is suitable for students who are creative, logical, critical thinkers and problem solvers. Students will learn about computer sciences which includes binary, data representation, coding, robotics, the foundations to building a personal website, multimedia and the inside of computers. Year 10 digital technologies then lead to–<strong> 1DIT > 2DIT or 2DIP > 3DIT or 3DIP</strong> (Digital technologies with programming).</p>

    <div data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>Topics and Units</h2>
      <p>During digital technologies courses, students will expect to participate in these units:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding/programming for games, websites and design</li>
        <li>Programming Robotics</li>
        <li>Learning about how a computer works</li>
        <li>Python coding</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>And later might be introduced to:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
        <li>Software and Computer Engineering</li>
        <li>Digital Media</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Is Digital Technologies Involved with BDSC?</h2>
      <p>In BDSC, digital technologies is involved everywhere, in classes and is responsible for most of the school’s websites like the web portal, student hub and library as well as the college system. I think that digital technologies within our college mainly supports our school websites accessible to all 2000 students and staff members, this mainly helps with the school system administration for teachers and parents/caregivers. Without these websites, it wouldn't be much of a school and the support for students will likely drop. It also involves lots of students who are interested in the coding area and develop websites as a hobby.</p>

      <p><strong>"It's a unique course with many opportunities of future pathways to university, with lots of problem solving and brain work but it is very enjoyable."</strong></p>
      <p><i>- Anonymous Student (3DIP)</i></p>

      <p><strong>"We use it to study (Teams, researching, etc.) and to access information about the school (the school website) and even the wider world."</strong></p>
      <p><i>- Anonymous Student (9DIT)</i></p>

      <p><strong>"It forms the infrastructure and security at school, segments the network and also the firewalls."</strong></p>

      <h2>How Can We Encourage Students to take Digital Technologies?</h2>
      <p>At BDSC, not many students are willing to take digital technology courses, but some who do might experience some difficulty with mainly developing applications. And yes, doing this especially as a job is hard. But Digital Technologies can teach you many valuable skills such as: critical thinking and problem solving. Digital technology school courses will teach you to structure codes to develop websites from scratch and this skill will help you work your way up to working in careers that include web, graphic and application designs.</p>

    <div data-aos="fade-right">
      <h2>Game Development</h2>
      <p>When it comes to game development, not just in BDSC but also outside where there are millions of games and developers. It all comes to coming up with original characters, ideas or concepts. Then most people will consider the game mechanics by planning the rules and how players experience the game. The important bits are the arts and visuals, so adding sprites, music, sound effects (SFX) for more realism. And to add final enhancements to a player's experience, you can add music compositions to make it feel more exciting.</p>
